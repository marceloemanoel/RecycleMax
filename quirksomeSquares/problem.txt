Quirksome Squares 
Time limit: 3.000 seconds

The number 3025 has a remarkable quirk: 
if you split its decimal representation in two strings of equal length 
(30 and 25) and square the sum of the numbers so obtained, you obtain the 
original number:

The problem is to determine all numbers with this property having a given even 
number of digits.

For example:
4-digit numbers run from 0000 to 9999. 

Note that leading zeroes should be taken into account. 
This means that 0001 which is equal to is a quirksome number of 4 digits.
The number of digits may be 2,4,6 or 8. 

Although maxint is only 32767 and numbers of eight digits are asked for, 
a well-versed programmer can keep his numbers in the range of the integers. 
However efficiency should be given a thought.

Input

The input of your program is a textflle containing numbers of digits 
(taken from 2,4,6,8), each number on a line of its own.

Output

The output is a textfile consisting of lines containing the quirksome numbers
 (ordered according to the input numbers and for each input number in increasing
  order).

Warning: Please note that the number of digits in the output is equal to the 
number in the corresponding input line : leading zeroes may not be suppressed.
